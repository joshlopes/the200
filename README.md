# WORK IN PROGRESS

**This project is not associated with the100!**

Consider this as my sandbox to improve and implement extra features of what I (@joshlopes) consider it would be beneficial to have.
You can use and abuse!

The100 support multiple games, but this sandbox of mine will only focus / and work for the game Destiny.

It can be improved in many ways, but the lack of documentation on the API makes it hard to complete.
(Call out for mike the100 or any other developer), please let me know about the api documentation / email and support this project!

As any sandbox project, this will occur in many mistakes and errors during this first versions

**Help is hugely appreciated**

# Goals behind

 There are features missing on the current state of the100. This project will serve to "fill" this gaps in 
 what i consider a good / nice-to-have feature.
 
 If you have more feature ideas or you want to discuss some of this please open an Issue to discuss about it.
